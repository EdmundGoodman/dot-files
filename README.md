# Dot files

## Motivation

My current normal settings for a Linux machine, allowing me to pull down this repo to quickly and easily get to a familiar workspace on a new machine.

## Usage

To copy all the files to the home directory and install a few programs such as `zsh`, just run the `run.sh` script:

```bash
$ ./run.sh
```

## Other notes

Note that the run script uses `apt` so the package manager may need to be manually changed for other distros
